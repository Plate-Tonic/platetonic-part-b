## Frontend

Built with HTML, CSS, and React, the frontend creates the user interface and fetches data from the backend via API requests. It dynamically updates the UI based on user interactions and API responses. The frontend will be deployed via Netlify.

### HTML and CSS

HTML provides the structure of web pages. CSS is used for styling, layout, and responsiveness.

### React

React manages the dynamic components:

- **Registration and login**.
- **User dashboard** - Displays user data, meal plans, and subscription details.
- **TDEE calculator and calorie/macronutrient tracker** - Tracks calorie and macronutrient intake.
- **Meal plan menu** - Displays available meal plans.
- **Subscription plan menu** - Handles plan selection and management.
- **Blog posts** - Displays health and nutrition articles.

## Backend

Built using Node.js and Express.js, the backend handles business logic, data processing, authentication, and API routing. It utilises middleware for logging, error handling, and request validation, while environment variables manage configurations for scalability. The backend will be deployed via Render.

### Node.js and Express.js

Key components include:

- **Authentication service** - Manages user login and registration using JWT authentication.
- Calorie and macronutrient tracker - Monitors and stores user calorie and macronutrient intake.
- **Meal plan service** - Fetches and stores personalised meal plans based on user preferences.
- **Subscription service** - Handles user subscriptions and integrates with **Stripe** for payment processing.
- **Blog service** - Manages blog content, including creation, updates, and retrieval.

### Mongoose

Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library that structures and interacts with MongoDB. It queries the database to retrieve, update, and store data.

## Database

The database communicates with the backend by sending and receiving structured documents.

### MongoDB

The application uses MongoDB to store:

- **User data** - Account details, macro tracking, dietary preferences, and payment records.
- **Meal plan data** - Tailored meal plans based on user preferences and goals.
- **Subscription data** - User subscription details, including plan type and payment status.
- **Blog data** - Health and nutrition articles.

## Third Party APIs

### Stripe

Stripe is integrated as the payment gateway to handle subscriptions and payments securely.

The process involves:

1. **Frontend** - Provides a payment form where users enter card details. **Stripe.js** securely tokenises the card information and sends it to Stripe’s servers.
2. **Backend** - Communicates with Stripe’s API using a **secret key** to create a payment intent and process transactions.
3. **Webhooks** - Stripe webhooks are used to handle payment events (e.g. successful payments, subscription cancellations) and update the database accordingly.
4. **Database** - Payment status and subscription details are stored in MongoDB.

# R6 Screenshots of your Trello board throughout the duration of the project

Our team used Trello to implement Agile methodology and streamline task management. Trello’s visual interface made it easy to track progress at a glance.

To organise our workflow, we structured our Trello board into four lists representing task progress:

- **To Do** - Pending tasks.
- **Doing** - Tasks in progress.
- **Review** - Completed tasks awaiting feedback.
- **Done** - Approved and finalised tasks.

We followed an iterative approach, moving tasks through these stages. Once a task reached the Review column, team members provided feedback to ensure it met project standards. After approval, the task was documented in the README file on our repository and moved to Done.

In addition to Trello, our team held weekly check-ins to review progress and discuss pain points. We also used Discord for ongoing collaboration, allowing us to discuss the project in real time. This approach helped maintain alignment and adaptability throughout the development process.

## 28 January

Cards have been created with detailed checklists for clarity. The team has established a structured check-in schedule, meeting every Thursday to review progress. A final check-in has been scheduled on the day of the deadline to ensure all tasks are completed and project objectives are met.

## 31 January

Weekly check-ins have been shifted to Fridays to better align with our personal schedules. The "Website Description" has been completed, and team members have begun working on "User Stories" and "Wireframes".

Adjustments have been made to the "Wireframes" checklist to streamline certain pages for simplicity.

## 14 February

The team has begun adding components to the README file in the repository. The "Data Flow Diagram" has been completed, while the "Wireframes" have been re-evaluated for further refinement, requiring additional adjustments to the home page and user dashboard.

Adjustments have been made to the "Application Architecture Diagram" checklist for a more detailed breakdown of the required tasks.
